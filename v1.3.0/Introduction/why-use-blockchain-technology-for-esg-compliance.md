Topl's Blockchain-as-a-Service (<<glossary:BaaS>>) offering provides frictionless access to Topl's underlying distributed ledger network. Designed to suit everyone from startups to large enterprises, Topl's blockchain delivers state of the art capabilities for verifying <<glossary:ESG>> compliance. 

By leveraging BaaS, you will be able to build a unique blockchain-powered application without the need to actually deploy or operate your own node or blockchain infrastructure. Topl's API-accessible hosted blockchain nodes together with Brambl API libraries are intended to enable a fast and easy development process.

During this Beta period, we are only providing access to our testnet (Valhalla) running on version Dion (v1.3.x). However, we will soon be opening up access to our mainnet blockchain as well to support full production deployments.
