All requests submitted through BaaS require an API key. This allows our service to authenticate your account to enforce API quotas. 

It is mandatory that you sign up for a free API key which allows for many advantages: 
* a **high request rate** and concurrent request limit
* **fast** responses with few retries and timeouts
* useful **metric tracking** for performance tuning and to analyze your customer behavior
* Access to our Genus offerings including the ability to query archived data and advanced logging capabilities (not yet released)
