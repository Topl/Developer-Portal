Topl's BaaS API enables users to create and broadcast blockchain transactions as well as query the blockchain for already submitted information. Together with Brambl, users can experience full blockchain functionality without needing to operate their own blockchain node or setup any infrastructure themselves.

We are in the process of migrating all documentation into a single hub, but you can currently access all API documentation via Postman ([link](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2571679/Tz5p5HfD)).
