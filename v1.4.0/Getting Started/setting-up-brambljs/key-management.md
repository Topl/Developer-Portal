Key Management as it currently exists in blockchains is unfamiliar to the vast majority of the population. It is not as simple as signing up for an address with your email and password and can be intimidating at first blush.

If not understood properly, poor key management can result in loss of access to your address and any assets held there.

Let's take a look at how Topl's makes key management more developer friendly. 

# BramblJS KeyManager 
The <<glossary:KeyManager>> object is the primary API for interacting with Topl keyfiles in BramblJS. The object takes four arguments in its constructor, which defines different properties of the keyfiles. 

Please follow the recipes below to interact with the Brambl KeyManager!
